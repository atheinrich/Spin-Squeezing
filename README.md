# General
This repository includes simulations and other components for the investigation of spin squeezing and related topics in Bose-Einstein condensates.\
The Dicke model is largely functional but is still in development. Examples are provided in the documentation.\
Everything else is a work in progress.\
Check comments in the code for documentation.

# Version list
Critical dependencies include Python, matplotlib, and numpy. Convenient dependencies include scipy, tqdm, and qutip. The code must be altered throughout to remove tqdm dependence if desired.

Python      3.11.0\
matplotlib  3.9.2\
numpy       1.23.5\
scipy       1.9.3\
tqdm        4.66.1\
qutip       5.0.3

# Installation
Clone the repository using git or simply copy the desired code directly. The only atypical package I use is tqdm, so install it or adjust the code to remove its dependence.
